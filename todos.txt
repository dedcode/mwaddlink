Todos:

# TODO 1:  Finalize the backtest protocoel (Djellel is working on it)

# TODO 2: Compute the frequency of mentions (Djellel can try an Algo he found.. but holding off: it might be resolved by Todo5 )
- Compute the frequency of mentions (Martin, to check Tiziano code)

# TODO 3: memory-mapping of embeddings

Desired changes for the future:

# Future 1: Ideally.. change this whole process to Spark and work with mediawiki_wikitext 

# Future 2: Unified navigation using Wikidata. (Martin please refine?)
