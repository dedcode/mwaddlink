Todos:

# TODO 1: generate a list containing the title of all redirects and disambiguation
# save the list in a pickle to reuse it.
# Maybe, it's good to discard any recommendation pointing to a redirect/disambiguation (Djellel)

# TODO 2: extract the (page_id, page_title) mapping file
# It seems that the navigation embeddings are indexed on page_id (Djellel)

# TODO 3: deal with special links (categories, files, etc.)
# deal with this using a fixed list of actual links in Wikipedia (enwiki-latest-all-titles-in-ns0.gz) (Djellel)

# TODO 4: compute the frequency of dictionary entries ( might be redundant with 5 )

# TODO 5: Compute the frequency of mentions (Martin, ask Tiziano)

# TODO 6: Add back levenstein distance. (Djellel)


Desired changes for the future:

# Future 1: Ideally.. change this whole process to Spark and work with mediawiki_wikitext
